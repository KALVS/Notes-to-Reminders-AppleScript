# Notes to Reminders
 This is a little weekend code project I made. This will go into a specific note on your Mac, format it and create reminders


# Disclaimer
This is built for MY own to do list that I share with my partner.
If you want to use this, you will need to change the specified note 'To Do  TH 2024 Edition' to whatever you want
and you will need to specify the reminder list from 'To do' to whatever you want.
I also have set the script to run through automator to run on Sundays, if you are going to run it on another day, you will need to change the day offset and the day of the week list.

Thanks for reading. :)
